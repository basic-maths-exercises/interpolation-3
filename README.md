# Functions of functions

What you have just done is arguably the most useful way of writing a function to do linear interpolation.  You pass the two points at which you know the function together with a list of points at which you want to evaluate the interpolated function to your function for doing interpolation.  In this exercise, we are, however, going to take this idea one step further in order to illustrate the fact that we can write Python functions that take another function as input.   To see what I mean consider the following code that generates a graph of ![](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=sin(x)):

````
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

def gendata( func ) : 
  xvals = np.linspace( -2*np.pi, 2*np.pi, 500 )
  yvals = func( xvals )
  return xvals, yvals  # Notice how we pass two variables back here

xv, yv = gendata( np.sin ) # so calling the function sets two variables
plt.plot( xv, yv, "k-" )
plt.savefig( "sine.png" )
````

Notice that the y-values in the graph at the end are generated by applying `func` to the values in the array called `xvals`.  Furthermore, we tell the program that we want func to correspond to `np.sin` in the call to `gendata` when we write:

````
xv, yv = gendata( np.sin )
````

We thus could instead have written any of the following calls:

````
xv, yv = gendata( np.cos ) 
xv, yv = gendata( np.exp )
xv, yv = gendata( np.tanh )
````

and with just this change the same code would have plotted ![](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\cos(x)), ![](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\exp(x)) or ![](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\tanh(x)).  We can even write something that uses a function we have written ourselves as follows:

````
def myx2( x ) : 
   return x*x 

xv, yv = gendata( myx2 )
````

Cool huh!  

To see if you have understood this idea see if you can complete the function called `linear_interpolation` that is shown in `main.py`.  This function takes four arguments:

1. `x` - the value that you would like to know the function at
2. `x1` - the start point of the interval that we are interpolating the function over so `x1<x`
3. `x2` - the end point of the interval that we are interpolating the function over so `x<x2`
4.`func` - the function that we are evaluating at `x1` and `x2` and interpolating at `x`

This function should calculate the interpolated value of the function `func` at `x` using:

![](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=f(x)=f(x_1)%2B\frac{f(x_2)-f(x_1)}{x_2-x_1}(x-x_1))

where the function ![](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=f) is `func`.  I have written some code at the end of the program to test whether your function is working correctly
